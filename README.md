# CaseNotes 
The purpose of CaseNotes is to provide a single lightweight application program to run on the Microsoft Windows platform to allow incident responders & forensic analysts and examiners of any discipline to securely record their contemporaneous notes electronically.
This is especially useful as more and more jurisdictions are enforcing regulatory standards for investigations, like ISO17025 in the United Kingdom.
CaseNotes stores your notes, checklists and screen captures in a SQLite database that can optionally be encrypted for additional security. 
It has been used by thousands of forensic analysts around the world since 2003 – we’re very excited to finally release this new version, which has so many new features, based on user requests.

I've decided to open-source the code for CaseNotes - so you are welcome to download the source code, modify it and use it without restriction.
If you want the last compiled executable, you can find that under releases - the most up-to-date version is 2.18.4.3.
